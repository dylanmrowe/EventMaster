# EventMaster
View the current app progress here:

Note: If you try to use this locally on chrome, you need to disable cross-origin requests in order for the menu to work. Or I think you can use firefox.

The menu should work on the above link though.

MAKING A NEW PAGE
-----------------------

To make a new page:
  <ul>
    <li> Copy samplepage.html and samplepage.css
    <li> Rename both files to the same thing (Ex. homepage.html, homepage.css)
    <li> Follow instructions in the .html file to create your page.
  </ul>

Note: The samplepage.html file requires the files in the 'css' folder and 'images' folder to function properly. 
      Make sure you have those in the same directory as your page.

CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------------
What it does so far:
  <ul>
    <li> Pages made based off samplepage.html should have a working menu
    <li> Menu Links to Profile Page
  </ul>
