MAKING A NEW PAGE
-----------------------

To make a new page:
  <ul>
    <li> Copy samplepage.html and samplepage.css
    <li> Rename both files to the same thing (Ex. homepage.html, homepage.css)
    <li> Follow instructions in the .html file to create your page.
  </ul>

Note: The samplepage.html file requires the files in the 'css' folder and 'images' folder to function properly. 
      Make sure you have those in the same directory as your page.
